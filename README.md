PilSeung (필승) is a Korean term and philosophy meaning "Certain Victory". It is a promise to oneself to have full dedication to a goal and outcome.

PilSeung Fighter (PSF 필승전사) is a Taekwondo sparring scoring system designed around judge and audience impressions of the fight. The goal is to reward fighters that have a dynamic and aggressive style while still exhibiting martial spirit and integrity.

#### Ultra Level Competition

Athletes aged 41 and older may compete at this level, fighting for one (1) round of 20 second duration.

## Competition Scoring

The main scoring criteria is *Presentation* which represents the judges interest in seeing the contestant fight. 

Conditions that would improve a judges interest in a contestant include: 

1. Actively attacking or defending
2. Exciting, dynamic offensive techniques and smart and practical defensive techniques
3. Powerful techniques that deliver trembling shock to the opponent's valid scoring areas
4. Good sportsmanship, clean technique, and self-control
5. Clear mastery of combat sport, strategy, charisma, and athleticism

The degree to which the judges award presentation points for the above criteria is up to each judge to determine, but generally 0.1 to 0.3 points per second.

### Presentation Score Interpretation

At the end of the match, judges may adjust their final presentation score. The score interpretation are as follows:

#### Presentation Score Only (No PSS)

| Score       | 0.0 to 2.0  | 2.1 to 4.0 | 4.1 to 5.0    | 5.1 to 6.0 |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Performance | Very Poor   | Poor       | Below Average | Average    |

| Score       | 6.1 to 7.0 | 7.1 to 8.0 | 8.1 to 9.0 | 9.1 to 9.9   | 10.0    |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------- |
| Performance | Good       | Very Good  | Excellent  | Near Perfect | Perfect |

#### Presentation and Technical Score (With PSS)

If the PSS is available, then the presentation score is provided on a 0.0-6.0 scale

| Score       | 0.0 to 1.2  | 1.3 to 2.4 | 2.5 to 3.0    | 3.1 to 3.6 |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Performance | Very Poor   | Poor       | Below Average | Average    |

| Score       | 3.7 to 4.2 | 4.3 to 4.8 | 4.9 to 5.4 | 5.5 to 5.9   | 6.0     |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------- |
| Performance | Good       | Very Good  | Excellent  | Near Perfect | Perfect |

### Presentation Score Goes Down Over Time for Inactivity

Since inactivity is the default behavior of contestants and judges can't be expected to all score exactly regularly over time, the scoring system handles deducting points for inactivity. Contestants automatically lose points over time for inactivity at the rate of 4.0 presentation points (2.4 if PSS is available) over the match duration; these are offset if the judges deem the contestant is being active.

### Deductions

Infractions that are scored by the judges by a 0.1 deduction from presentation:

1. Avoidance
2. Pushing an opponent out of bounds or pushing the kicking opponent
3. Low kick
4. Punching to the head in a full head-contact division
5. Blocking with the knee
6. Pushing the kicking opponent
7. Attacking while out of bounds

Infractions that are scored by the judges by a 0.2 deduction from presentation and can result in disqualification by the referee:

1. Attacking the fallen opponent
2. Attacking while fallen
3. Attacking after Kalyeo
4. Punching to the head in a non or light head-contact division

Infractions that are scored by the referee by activating the penalty timer:

1. Grabbing
2. Falling
3. Going out of bounds

## Competition Method

### Cutoff

In the cutoff method, contestants progress through one or more rounds of fighting. The starting round is determined by the number of registered contestants. If necessary, there shall be a *Tie-breaker* round with sufficient matches required to determine 1st, 2nd, and 3rd/4th place contestants.

| Round       | Contestants | Advance      |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Finals      | 8 or fewer  | Top 4 place  |
| Semi-Finals | 9 to 19     | Top 8        |
| Preliminary | 20 or more  | Top half     |

For the first round, contestants are ranked by seeding (if available) and the bracket and matches are built accordingly. That is, the highest seed fights the lowest seed (or gets a bye), and the 2nd highest seed fights the 2nd lowest seed, and so on. If there are an odd number of contestants, then contestant after the middle seed fights twice: once with the contestant before the middle seed, and the contestant with the middle seed. If a contestant fights more than once in any round, that contestant's score is the average of all their matches. Thereafter, the contestant ranking establishes subsequent round seeding order and the bracket and matches are built accordingly.

At the end of each round, contestants are ranked according to their performance in their match for that round:

#### Cutoff Ranking Criteria

1. No DSQ 
2. No WDR
3. Presentation Score
4. Win
5. Technical Score (if available)
6. Lower Deductions
7. Tie-breaker match

Note that it's possible to lose a match and still rank higher than your opponent if the judges (and audience if available) deem your fighting performance to be more exciting, entertaining, and better adherence to the spirit of good competition.

At the end of the *Preliminary* round, the top half (round up)of the contestants advance to the *Semi-Finals* round. If there is a tie at the bottom half of contestants, then all tied contestants advance. For example, in a division of 15, the top 8 advance. If, in this example, contestants #8, #9, and #10 are tied, then all 3 advance. 

At the end of the *Semi-Finals* round, the top 8 advance to the *Finals* round; again if there is a tie at #8 and #9 or beyond, then all of these tied contestants advance.


At the end of the *Finals* round, the top 4 place. If there are any ties, a *Tie-breaker* match shall be used to resolve the ties. 

Contestants that are *Disqualified* do not advance or place.

Contestants that *Withdraw* in the *Preliminary* or *Semi-Finals* round do **not** advance for the safety of the contestant. Contestants that *Withdraw* from a *Finals* round match do not place. Contestants that *Withdraw* from a tiebreaker match may still place.

**Example 1** 
There is a tie for 1st and 2nd, the tie-breaker match shall be used to determine who of the 2 contestants is 1st, using the cutoff ranking criteria. 

**Example 2**
There is a 3-way tie for #2, #3, and #4. Two of the 3 contestants are randomly selected to face-off in a match. The higher-ranked contestant of the match then fights against the remaining contestant. The contestant that fights twice has their matches ranking criteria averaged. All 3 contestants are then ranked according to the *Cutoff Ranking Criteria*. 

### Single Elimination

In the single elimination method, contestants progress through one or more rounds of fighting, with the starting round determined by the number of registered contestants.
