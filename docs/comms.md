# Pilsung Fighter Communication Protocol (PSFCP)

## Server-Client Communication

Server-Client communication is established using websockets, which may be configured for direct port-to-port communication or via proxy/reverse proxy (for encrypted communications) using the Apache webserver.

The default port for PSFCP is 3030.

Most communication is initiated by a client. Typically a client makes a request to the server to provide some service, and the server provides a response or an error in return.

One notable exception is server pings to gauge client connection strength.
